    <div class="st"><center><p>Climate change isthe change in global or regional climate patterns attributed largely to
      the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels.
      <br>Majority do not pay mind to the matter of climate change as they should and as
      time progresses it continues to become a larger problem if no action is taken. Humans continue to
      rely on the use of nonrenewable energy sources and portray a careless attitude towards the progressing
      conflict of climate change. Carbon pollution from burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas is
       warming our planet and throwing natural systems out of balance and is also at an all time high from the fossil fuel industry.
      <br>Climate change is witnessed throughout the lives of people. And it is up to the people to take action
       to combat it. To preserve our planet and further advance its stability. Everything humans have been doing
       to hurt the environment needs to be altered to reduce the decay of our planet.</p></center></div>

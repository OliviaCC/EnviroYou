<center><h2 style="color:white;"> What is Ocean Pollution ? </h2> </center>
<p class="ex1" style="color:white; text-indent:20px;"> Ocean Pollution also known as  marine pollution occurs when harmful effects result from the entry into the ocean of chemicals,
  particles, industrial, agricultural, and residential waste, noise,or the spread of invasive organisms. Eighty percent of marine pollution comes from land.
  Knowing about ocean pollution and why it's so harmful is important because pollution does not only affect marine life and their environment,it also affects mankind. Chemicals such as oil,
   mercury, lead, pesticides, and other heavy metals can all be found within the ocean and can contaminate water supplies and our food chain by affecting the marine
   life involved. We as humans contriute alot to ocean pollution for example When we burn fossil fuels, we don’t pollute the air but the oceans, too. Indeed,
   today’s seas absorb as much as a quarter of all man-made carbon emissions, which changes the pH of surface waters and leads to acidification.
    This problem is rapidly worsening—oceans are now acidifying faster than they have in some 300 million years. It’s estimated that by the end of this century,
    if we keep pace with our current emissions practices, the surface waters of the ocean could be nearly 150 percent more acidic than they are now.</p>

<center><p> 8 shocking facts about Ocean Pollution :</p></center>
<div style="height:1000px;background-color:white;font-size:26px;color:#add8e6">
<p> Fact #1 - Covering more than 70 percent of our planet, oceans are among the earth’s most valuable natural resources. They govern the weather, clean the air,
  help feed the world, and provide a living for millions. They also are home to most of the life on earth, from microscopic algae to the blue whale, the largest
  animal on the planet. Yet we’re bombarding them with pollution.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Fact #2 - When we burn fossil fuels, we don’t pollute the air but the oceans, too. Indeed, today’s seas absorb as much as a quarter of all man-made carbon emissions,
  which changes the pH of surface waters and leads to acidification. This problem is rapidly worsening—oceans are now acidifying faster than they have in some 300
  million years. It’s estimated that by the end of this century, if we keep pace with our current emissions practices, the surface waters of the ocean could be
  nearly 150 percent more acidic than they are now.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fact #3 - Causes of ocean pollution Littering, Sewage, Ocean mining, Oil spills, Agricultural runoff, Toxic chemicals, Air pollutants, Maritime transportation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fact #4 - According to a study done by the University of Georgia, 18 billion pounds of plastic trash winds up in our oceans each year. To put that in perspective,
   it’s enough trash to cover every foot of coastline around the world with five full trash bags of plastic...compounding every year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fact #5 - China and Indonesia are the world’s biggest contributors of plastic pollution in the ocean. Combined, they account for one-third of total ocean pollution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fact #6 - The 5 most common items found in coastal cleanups around the world are all single-use plastics. They are: plastic cigarette butts, food wrappers,
  plastic beverage bottles, plastic bottle caps, and plastic straws and drink stirrers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fact #7 - There are more plastic than fish : Eight million metric tons: That’s how much plastic we dump into the oceans each year.That’s about 17.6 billion pounds —
  or the equivalent of nearly 57,000 blue whales — every single year. By 2050, ocean plastic will outweigh all of the ocean’s fish.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fact #8 - Oil is the fastest source of deterioration to the ocean, being far more harmful than trash and waste. However, only a small percentage of oil (around 12%)
   dumped in the ocean comes as a result of actual oil spills. Most oil causing harm in the ocean is a result of drainage from land. Oil spills suffocate marine life
   to death, and leads to behavioral changes and a breakdown in thermal insulation to those that do survive. It essentially changes the entire ecosystem of an
   affected area, such as a long coastline or deep ocean.</p>
